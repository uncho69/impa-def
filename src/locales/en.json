    "introductionText1": "Trust issues are the reason why blockchains were created; it was Bitcoin, and the lack of trust of its creators towards traditional monetary systems backed by governments (fiat: USD, EUR, JPY, etc.) that first ignited the flame of this decentralized revolution.",
    "introductionText2": "As we know, the Bitcoin blockchain, especially at the time, was still limited to being mainly a good store of value, in the form of BTC currency, which miners could produce in their garages and earn something. It didn't last long (the garage part), as it was soon discovered that the rewards (blocks) were limited: as more and more GPUs were used for mining, it was no longer possible to do it with regular home computers, but larger and more complex facilities had to be set up to mine BTC.",
    "introductionText3": "Web3 technologies have the ability to improve people's lives when they work correctly and when users know what they're doing. Unfortunately, the industry has had a relatively high barrier to entry for those who are not tech-savvy, ordinary people.",

    "governanceText3": "Whitelisted voters also decide how to distribute each Imparodefi epoch budget among approved projects. The allocation will then be divided equally between Creator Pools and Promoter Pools.",
    "governanceText4": "This function may change in the future, allowing whitelisted voters to vote on the percentage distribution of rewards between the two pools for each project."
